                            Hey! I am a software developer with a background in Information Systems and Web Development.
                            I graduated from San Jose State University in the Spring of 2020 during the onset of the
                            pandemic. Despite the challenging job market, I utilized this time to expand my knowledge
                            by self-educating in finance and options trading. It was quite a profitable experience.
                            However, as the world began to reopen, I wanted to refresh my skills in Python and mySQL
                            and discovered a passion for web development through an online JavaScript course.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I subsequently enrolled in an accelerated, in-person full-stack web development program in
                            Irvine, California where I acquired comprehensive skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js,
                            Express.js, PostgreSQL, React, data structures and algorithms. Having completed the program,
                            I am currently working as a Web Dev TA and continue to improve my skills through daily
                            leetcoding. I am now seeking new opportunities to apply my skills in the web development
                            industry.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Here are some technologies that I have been working with recently:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="row">
                <ul className='sfmono grey-text skills'>
                    <li><Caret /> JavaScript (ES5 / ES6)</li>
                    <li><Caret /> TypeScript</li>
                    <li><Caret /> HTML</li>
                    <li><Caret /> CSS</li>
                    <li><Caret /> React</li>
                    <li><Caret /> Node.js</li>
                    <li><Caret /> Express.js</li>
                    <li><Caret /> PostgreSQL</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
